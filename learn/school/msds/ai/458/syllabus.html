        Description: An introduction to the field of artificial intelligence, this course illustrates probability-rule-based generative models as well as discriminative models that learn from training data. The course reviews applications of artificial intelligence and deep learning in vision and language processing. Students learn best practices for building supervised learning models and, in particular, deep neural networks for classification and regression. Students also learn about feature engineering, autoencoders, and strategies of unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning. This is a project-based course with extensive programming assignments.
        <p>- Identify key phases in the history of artificial intelligence (AI), including recent developments in deep learning.</p>
        <p>- Distinguish among supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning problems.</p>
        <p>- Describe the structure and operation of neural networks, including deep learning networks.</p>
        <p>- Employ neural networks and deep learning to address classification and regression problems (supervised learning with backpropagation).</p>
        <p>- Employ probability-rule-based, generative models for deep learning.</p>
        <p>- Describe the relevance of AI and deep learning methods to a wide range of applications, including vision and natural language processing.</p>
